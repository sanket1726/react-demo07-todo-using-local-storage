# Todo app using `Context API and Local Storage`

> * Sixth app is Todo app using Local Storage. Working and functionalities are same but instead of saving locally. I stored the todos on local storage and fetched them from it.

> * While doing this app I studied about useEffect hook which is used to tell the react that what to do after render. Also implemented events concept.

## Concepts learnt --> 

> * `useEffect` -> used to guide react what to do  after render
> * The function passed to useEffect will run after the render is committed to the screen. Think of effects as an escape hatch from Reactâ€™s purely functional world into the imperative world.
> * By default, effects run after every completed render, but you can choose to fire them only when certain values have changed.
